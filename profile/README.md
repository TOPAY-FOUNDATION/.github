## About

**TOPAY Foundation** is a blockchain / Web3 organization founded with the mission to build an interest-free blockchain ecosystem. We combine ethical finance, transparency, and decentralized systems to deliver financial services that are fair, accessible, and built on trust.

- **Transparency & Integrity** — Open governance, auditable contracts, clear documentation.  
- **Global Access** — Built to serve users everywhere, across borders.  
- **Security & Innovation** — Incorporating strong cryptography (including post-quantum approaches, e.g. Z512), secure smart‐contracts, and modern tools.

## What We Do

- Develop blockchain infrastructure & smart contracts adhering to ethical finance constraints.  
- Produce cryptographic libraries (e.g. *TOPAY-Z512*) for use in JavaScript, Go, Rust, etc.
